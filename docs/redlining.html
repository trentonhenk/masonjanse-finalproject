      <h1>What is Redlining?</h1>
      <p> Ta-Nehisi Coats gives a detailed overview of redlining and its effects in his article titled “The Case for Reparations''. He explains that during the 1930s, the United States and its citizens were suffering from the post-war Great Depression. As a part of a greater New Deal-era strategy, the Federal Housing Association (FHA) worked with banks to lower down payments and interest rates for Americans seeking to buy a house. The plan worked, and millions of middle- and low-class Americans were able to purchase homes, sparking a massive economic boom. This allowed for generational wealth to be built. Researchers at Vanderbilt found that on average, homeownership represents the largest majority of most Americans' wealth (Dundon). Sadly, this access to one of the most significant generational wealth-building opportunities was not equal. Black Americans were legally barred from participating in homeownership through redlining. Coates tells the story of a young man, Clyde Ross, who attempted to buy a home in Chicago in the 1930s. He explains that although Ross had the financial resources to afford a home under the new policy, the banks denied his request for a loan. The FHA had built a sinister plan, physically drawing red lines over areas predominantly occupied by African American citizens. The red lines were drawn to represent an area as “hazardous.” The banks used these maps to guide who to give loans and who to deny.
      </p>
      <p>Redlining has created an insurmountable wealth gap between white and black families. The average net worth of a black American household is nearly $17,000 compared to the $170,000 of white counterparts. Wealth is not the only discrepancy created by these racist loaning practices.
      </p>
      <p>Wealth discrepancies are not the only lingering issues. Researchers have found that Redlining has also positioned minority communities in what is known as “sacrifice zones”. The phrase “sacrifice zone” is sadly a very fitting description of these areas. Some of the most common and well-researched effects of Redlining can be explored on this website. The main issue this project aims to explore is the connection between this racist practice and its lingering effects of unequal environmental health challenges.</p>
